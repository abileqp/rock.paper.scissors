## Introduction

The Rock-Paper-Scissors DApp brings a timeless game to the blockchain, offering an exciting opportunity for players to test their luck and strategic thinking. With Ethereum's smart contracts, you can play the game with trust and transparency, knowing that outcomes are determined fairly and rewards are distributed automatically.

## How It Works

### Smart Contract

The smart contract underpinning this DApp manages the entire gaming process. Here's how it works:

- **Stakes**: Players can participate by sending a specified amount of Ether as a stake (e.g., 0.0001 ETH) to the contract.
- **Game Logic**: Players select their move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the contract generates a random move for the house.
- **Game Resolution**: The smart contract determines the winner based on the game rules and distributes rewards accordingly (up to 2x the stake).
- **Game History**: Every game's outcome is recorded on the blockchain for transparency.

### Frontend

The user interface (UI) provides a seamless experience for players:

- **Game Play**: Users can select their move with the click of a button and initiate the game.
- **Outcome Display**: The UI shows the player's move, the house's move, and the game outcome (win, lose, or tie).
- **Game History**: A section displays the history of past games, allowing players to track their results.
